<center><p>Heyyyyyy....hiiiiiii...how y'all doin? Shout out to you for, you know, pressing the link. Means a lot. 
Me as an artist is pretty different from ~me~ most of the time. Typically you'll see me in all black(if you're lucky, grey)  and I like to keep my makeup and hair pretty dark. HOWEVER my art is always very much pink, very much girly fantasy. I've always had an internal battle with both of those aesthetics and which one I felt more comfortable in. Sometimes it's one, sometimes it's the other sometimes it's both. In my art I typically let the repressed feminine side come out, visually it's something I like and makes me feel comfortable. Iâ€™ve always been a pretty artistic person starting off from a young age. I stayed getting in trouble for putting stickers all over the house and even my parents' car. From then it grew to drawing and then I found tumblr :,). Tumblr is where I found a lot of the interests and personality traits I still have TO THIS DAY. From there I started to love looking at art through a screen, however I still appreciate the classics. Everyone's taste is different and in the art world there's always a place for anyone. That's what I like about it. If you can't find anywhere to be, you can be here! I'll be your friend <3. Uhhhhh anywaysssss, I hope you enjoyed my lil website and my lil art. I appreciate your time. Thank you. </p></center>
