      <p>This art was done in a digital art class at DCP Alum Rock High School</p>
       <text-align: justify;><p>This piece was made on the medium of photoshop. I imported a picture I had taken to photoshop then tranced and colored over it until the image was filled up. I also added different effects like glare and a colorful background to make the image stand out more. I remember a goal I had with this was for me to not look washed out with the background of my image. This was a different type of art that I wasn't used to especially coloring on photoshop however it was a nice learning experience.

<h2>"Miami Geofilter"</h2>

       <text-align: justify;><p>In this art project we were supposed to create a geofilter tag like those seen on the social media site of  snapchat. I chose the city of Miami because I love the nightlife in the city. I created the filter in photoshop using shape, coloring, and the pen tools. After i had made it transparent and applied it to a picture of Miami that i found from google with my friend and i photoshopped in. My goal was to make this look realistic with the lighting from the background and me and my friend cropped in. This gave me new insight into what goes into designing the geofilters on snapchat and it's not as simple as one may think it is.</p>

 <h2>"scawee comic"</h2>

      <h7><center> <img src="images/comic.jpg" class="img-fluid" style=" width : 500px;"> </center></h7>
      <p>This art was done in a digital art class at DCP Alum Rock High School</p>
       <text-align: justify;><p>In this piece we were required to make a scary comic strip using photoshop. The premise is based from the popular urban scary story where a girl reaches to her dog to lick her in re-assurance that everything is ok. Come to find out, “humans can lick too”. I used the paint feature in this for the majority of it. A goal I had was to fit the story within the frames of the story comic, and thankfully I did that. Something I didn't know was about how long the coloring process would be as well as the placement of the story time frames heavily impacts the storyline as well as the art involved.</p>

<h2>"Makeup Product Design"</h2>

       <text-align: justify;><p>For this assignment we had to come up with a product that would help us in our everyday lives and create a logo for it in adobe illustrations. For me this was makeup since i typically would wear it everyday, if not every other day. I also have very oily skin so I “created” a power that kept you matte looking all day. In adobe illustration I made this by using shape, color, and text tools. A goal of mine was to keep the colors light to appeal as a “fresh” product. </p></center>
