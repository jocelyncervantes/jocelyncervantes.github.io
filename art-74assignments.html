      <p>This art was done in a digital art class at SJSU</p>
       <text-align: justify;><p>This art piece was a "mememash up" where we had to incorporate memes into one single image composition. I did this using photoshop. Something funny about this was I only used images I had saved in my camera roll so the memes used in the image are pretty fresh in popularity. To do this I had created a general background, then I added the images and masked them. After I cleaned them up and placed them where I saw fit in the background. A goal I had for this was to make it super surrealistic and kind of like a fever dream type of thing, which I think I accomplished.

<h2>"Code as Art- P5.javascript Self-Portrait"</h2>
      <h3> April, 2019</h3>
      <h7><center> <img src="images/code self portrait.jpg" class="img-fluid" style=" width : 500px;"> </center></h7>
      <p>This art was done in a digital art class at SJSU</p>
       <text-align: justify;><p>This art piece is a self portrait done in P5 javascript. I created my art by copying and pasting the code I needed from the reference page. The code was to make up a shape, once on the javascript editor I was able to modify the code by changing the presets therefore changing the direction in which the shape was going into. There was a specific image that inspired me to do my work. I just had in mind a generic idea of what I looked like and my most basic features and included them in this artwork. A goal I had here was to at least make it look somewhat like me, for some reason I really struggled with this code but I think in the end it turned out fine.
